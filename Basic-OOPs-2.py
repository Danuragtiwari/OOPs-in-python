# self:-
# OOPs fundamental is only object of a class can have access of all the methods of the class,so self is used,self is the current object.

# Instance variable:-
# those variable that are introduced in the constructor,that value are different for different objects.

# Encapsulation:-
# getter and setter method to secure the data 

# Nothing in python is truly private
# let example:-atm_project.py
# normally use sbi=atm()
# have acceess of sbi.balance ,and use __balance for private in interpreter is create varible _atm__balance,can have access of it.
